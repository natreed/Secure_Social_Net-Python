# Secure Social Net (Python CLI)

#Background: 
Secure Social Net is an application built on the Matrix API. The goal is to build new social networking features using the API in it's current form. The command line client is a way to focus on the features themselves and how they are structured. The next step will be to integrate these features into a web app.

## Getting Started
- Since this is not really production code, I would recommend watching my little demonstration.
- Some visuals and explanations of program architecture and class hierarchies are available here beginning on slide 8.
